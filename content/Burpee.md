demonstration video:[[The Burpee]]
- from standing position
- drop to a plank; straight back, feet together, hands supporting you about shoulder-width apart
- do a pushup, without arching nor sagging the back; belly nor knees touching the ground
- from the plank after the pushup, gather the feet beneath you without the knees touching the ground
- from a crouched position, explode upwards, lifting the entire body off the ground
- the elbows are above the head and the hands make a clapping sound straight above the head
