### General
- Jojo doesn't know the plays or the formations
- Pearce going in motion on Jersey 1
- DEs loosing contain repeatedly
- OLBs not aligning correctly
- QB making bad decisions, getting nervous bad mechanics, missing easy throws
- FS Oliver not reacting to the run quick enough and helping tackle
- Other team's stalk blocks are way better than ours
- Counter was our most successful play
- Stick and Snag were not run correctly. QB rolling out for no reason; 3 steps throw
- Punted with 10 players

- 18:33 Seth breaking contain 
- 19:33 Henry getting blocked/held  for a big gain; not lined up at apex
