### My Personal Family Football Story

I didn't play football as a kid. My parents signed me up for 3 terrible sports.
- Baseball
- Wrestling
- Swimming

I was only good at swimming and did it until I was in 9th grade. I hate all racing sports by the way! I never got to play football, soccer, basketball or lacrosse.

I sent cellphone snaps of the billboard advertisements for kids to play youth football when my son was in elementary school to my wife.  She said, "No way!" CTE this, concussions that, etc. I was sad.

Then one day she said, "I signed up Grant for 6th grade football!"  What? Who are you and what did you do with my wife?!?!?

It was awesome, but we did not have a great season going 0-8. But Grant loved it!

The next year the wife said, "Not only did I sign up Grant again for football, but I volunteered you to coach!"  Ummm, I love and know a lot about football... but as a fan.  It is different to coach something.

It was ok. I was a Dad coach helping out our head coach who knew what he was doing and even had played semi-professional football.  It was great. We went 8-0!  Unfortunately our Center (who snaps the ball to the QB) go injured right before the playoffs. We lost to West Lin 6-0!  Not bitter!

I coached Grant again in 8th grade. He then went to play 4 years at Cleveland getting awards like Best Blocker, Best Tackler and Team Captain. Along the way he discovered Rugby, his true love. He played it 10-12th grade winning the championship twice!

My son, Grant, will be playing Division II Rugby at the Montana State University this year! Go Bobcats!

I tell all of this to highlight a common story. Moms (and Dads) are worried about their kids and take the concussions and CTE data very seriously.
1. We also take this seriously and teach kids the correct way to Rugby tackle (coincidentally) and protect themselves.
2. Football has been a great outlet for my son. It has also given him great confidence in working hard and competing at a high level. 

My son Grant, would not be playing Rugby at Montana State next year if he didn't play youth football!
