This family features three routes that can be run by different players and different positions. The routes
- clear out on the outside
- flat
- and the `stop` or `stick` route just inside the force player 
- 
This play puts the outside defender in conflict between covering the `stick` and the `flat`. He can't be right. The `Q` should throw wherever he isn't.## Assignments
