# Game Notes

## JoJo KR
- Should have let it go out of bounds
- Should never drop a live ball

## 1st Offensive Possession

### Indy 1
- Great job at Henry getting to the LB and blowing him up
- If Milo was patient, he would have cut inside of that block; instead flying kid into him
- Jude terrible play fake; turned around to watch the play

### Indy 1
- Same thing with Henry getting to 2nd level and Milo not reading it
- Jude terrible play fake; turned around to watch the play; stop doing this
- Good toughness from Milo

### Indy 1 F*
- Dropped by Avery
- This was a crack block, and Oliver DIDN'T block the inside defender!
- Milo poor fake of possession

### Option 2
- Terrible non-existent OZ+ blocking; unbelievable 
- Terrible decision to pitch the ball Jude
- Never stop on a pitch Milo
- All-around terrible play on 4th down!

## 1st Defensive Series

### 1st Down
- Henry miss-aligned; supposed pressed on the #2 when there are 3 WRs to one side
- Good breakup from Avery and Henry
- WR in the flat undefended; safety has #3 and was nowhere to be found

### 2nd Down
- Jude should have blitzed and is instead hopping around while others make the tackle
- Henry reads the run and knocks the kid down with force!

### 3rd Down
- Henry still not pressing the #2 WR in a group of 3 as he is supposed to
- Drake M in a two-handed battle with the DE instead of getting to his spot; he does this all game long
- Nice pick by Barrett at safety

## 2nd Offensive Possession

### Black Jersey 1
- Terrible timing from Jude; ball hits Z-motion Oliver causing a fumble
- Nice recovery by Oliver

### Green Fade Out
- JoJo or Levi running the wrong route combo
- Beautiful ball to Oliver on go route dropped
- Robert chasing the linebacker downfield is going to give us a penalty on a pass-block play. You have the Mike, but only if he comes

## 2nd Defensive Series

### 1st Down
- LBs Avery and Ben just standing in the middle of the field as the QB is looking to his right, their left
- Pass defensed by JoJo, nearly intercepted (WR pushed him in the back)

### 2nd Down
- Jude in terrible non-athletic position; surprised by the snap, then gets blocked backward by a smaller kid; no fight to disengage
- Henry on two steps forward at the snap; late to the hole, nice tackle though
- Avery coming downhill, goes for shoestring tackle rather than put the shoulder on the body

### 3rd Down
- I am screaming at the LBs to step up, and they just stand there 1 yard deep in the end zone they are supposed to be protecting
- Terrible tackling effort from Ben
- TD McDaniel

### PAT
- Jude still misaligned; not APEXED
- Avery and Ben too far away
- Terrible tackle by Ben #2; totally misses the QB in the hole

### KR
- JoJo too deep
- Pearce falls on the ball

## 3rd Offensive Possession

### Okie 2
- Milo cuts it upfield too soon, but nice run; bumps defender with ball and fumbles
- Turnover

## 3rd Defensive Series

### 1st Down
- #1 WR goes in motion, C Oliver goes with him
- Screen pass to flat; Henry's approach out of control
- Drake M pursues from DE, but slows down when he thinks someone else will make the tackle
- Backside pursuit from Drake B is pretty good down the LOS

### 2nd Down
- #2 WR on the weak side goes in motion; Jude follows but shouldn't have; the Safety takes the #3 (motion) player
- This opens up a huge hole on the backside

- Holding call brings it back.

### 2nd Down (again)
- Robert turns around from contact? Loses track of the play and the runner goes right by
- Terrible tackle from Hank, partially due to running into Robert

### 4th Down
- Nice de-cleater block from Oliver on punt return
- Jack standing straight up at the snap of the ball, surprised by the start of the play

## 4th Offensive Possession

### Green Flood?
- Ben chasing some kid down the field on a pass-blocking play; this will get us called for an ineligible man downfield

### Black Indy 1
- Andre goes to the wrong side of the QB for the handoff
- Nice improvisation from Jude for a first down

### Yellow Flo
- Andre didn't know where to motion to, was moving towards the LOS; should have been a penalty
- Jude rolls out and finds Oliver in the endzone for a TD; nice play

### PAT
- Good snap hits Jude in the hands and he fumbles it
- Recovers the ball to prevent a scoop and score from McDaniels

### KO
- Nice strip tackle from Henry; recovered by Drake B; big play
- Note: kid running left to right with the ball in his right hand (upfield); bad technique

## 5th Offensive Possession

### Yellow Something?
- Here is our most embarrassing stretch
- We only have 4 linemen on the field for 3 plays
  - Coaches should be embarrassed
  - Ben should be embarrassed
  - Drake M (the G next to the missing T) should be embarrassed
  - Pearce (the H-back lined up next to the missing T) should be embarrassed
  - Jude the QB and Milo the T should be embarrassed
  - This is why the T HAS to count all of the players EVERY time!
- Unsurprising that the DE sacks our QB on this play

### Yellow Ore 1 (minus the BS OT)
- Drake M touches the DE but then lets him go for some reason; you cannot do this; you could pass him to your G (Henry) if you reach him; you should have solo'd him and had Henry solo the LB
- Henry, you are walking on this play after not blocking anyone; unacceptable
- Terrible decision by Jude to pitch the ball and fumble it

### Green Ore 2
- Andre lined up incorrectly
- Jude nice run around the outside; would prefer you to walk out of bounds rather than being crumpled by the team's best player

### Black Indy 1 (Henry at T)
- Jude standing up instead of being ready for bad snaps
- Terrible snap by Robert; terrible block as well
- Jude falls on it
- Ben terrible block at the point of attack; two-handed pat and then did the same to the LB

### Black Indy 1 (again)
- Another terrible block from Robert
- Henry trying to make something happen, fumbles the ball

## 4th Defensive Series

- Hank makes nice surprise tackle all things considered

### 2nd Down
- Barrett standing in non-athletic stance, surprised by the snap of the ball
- Nice hit from Henry on the tackle
- Corbin getting bullied by a smaller kid; footwork is terrible

### 1st Down
- Incomplete pass
- Nice blitz from Avery

### 2nd Down
- Nice tackle from Drake M with help from Drake B

### 3rd Down
- Man in motion would have been open and Barrett didn't respond
- Incomplete pass to the flat

### 4th Down
- JoJo nice return for a TD
- Called back on Henry running into the kicker

### 4th Down (again)
- Jack runs into JoJo, pushing him out of bounds

## 6th Offensive Possession

### Black Okie 2

- Terrible stalk blocking from Avery

### Green Kota 1 (throw Smash)

### Green Okie 1
- Lazy, terrible block from Robert lets the NT into the backfield for a loss
- Terrible OZ- blocking combo from Drake B and Henry; I don't know what you are doing
- Drake M blocking back on OZ-; unbelievable!

### Green Okie 1
- Another disaster on the OL; absolutely terrible OZ- blocking!

### Green Okie 1 F*
- Terrible get-off from Oliver, lazily attacks the defender over #2; this is a crack block
- Nice route, nice throw, nice catch, and nice finish for a TD by Avery

### Green Okie 2
- Drake M blocks BACK on OZ+ blocking!!! The unblocked DE makes the tackle in the backfield; terrible
- Corbin the OG stands up and skips backward like the worst pass blocking set

### KO
- JoJo doesn't break down to make tackle, goes flying right by
- Calder, who is supposed to be the safety, lets the player outside of them; terrible
- Henry smashes the kid out of bounds for a 15-yard unnecessary roughness penalty

## 5th Defensive Series

### 1st Down
- Drake M misaligned and can't get to his spot, allowing the Jet player to get to the outside; this must stop
- Terrible defensive posture from Jude, not aggressive with the play coming his way
- Good job by JoJo reading the run play, shedding the blocker, and making the tackle

### 2nd Down
- Henry not aligned correctly; don't angle in. Face the LOS; take two read-steps and read running play; instead, you're getting blocked 10 yards away from where the ball is being run
- Avery dancing around, then goes for yet another shoestring tackle; STOP DOING THIS!

### 3rd Down
- Motion Jet to the outside
- Drake B runs right into a double team with OT and wing
- Henry not aligned correctly. There are 3 WRs to this side. Need to be pressed on #2
- Henry takes a terrible angle into the defender, gets blocked, and the play runs around the outside.
- Absolutely terrible tackling effort from Oliver ends in a TD

### KR
- Nice block by Henry giving the edge
- Nice return by JoJo
- Instead of cutting back inside, fake cutting inside will freeze the defender; but then cut back outside

## 7th Offensive Possession

### Yellow Jersey 2
- High snap by Robert ruins the play
- Jude recovers the fumble

### Yellow Jerse 2 F*
- We have no timeouts, so we wanted to quickly set up THIS play; we talked about it during the timeout
- But instead, Jude tosses it to Levi
- Levi, not realizing where we are in the game, DOESN'T run out of bounds when given the opportunity
- Thus, our special play which would have worked, DID NOT GET RUN!

### Half 12-13

## 6th Defensive Series

### 1st Down
- Motion play again
- Drake M fighting with and losing to OT and not getting to his position; play goes around the edge
- Jude running with the motion of the #2 WR despite NEVER being told to do this; the F takes the #3 to a side!!!
- Henry runs into the blocker and loses contain around the edge
- JoJo does a great job getting off the block to make the tackle; 4-yard gain could have been a lot worse

### 2nd Down
- Defensive encroachment

### 2nd Down (again)
- Jude sacks the QB

### 3rd Down
- Corbin jumps offside; look at the ball! It is closest to you

### 1st Down
- Broken play has the QB 7 yards deep in the backfield
- JoJo gets pushed by the QB at the last second
- Drake M pursuing from the backside, TOTALLY MISSES TO HIT THE QB FROM BEHIND; tries to do some terrible arm tackle; STOP DOING THIS
- Jude, your pursuit is terrible; you slow up when you think other players are going to make the tackle; STOP DOING THIS!

### 2nd Down
- Drake M you get to your spot, but you turn to get off the block; stop doing this; put your hand in the OT's chest; then shed and tackle

### 2nd Down
- Henry DOES NOT follow the motion to the other side because he should not
- Drake B gets blocked initially due to alignment issues; but stays with it for a TFL

### 3rd Down
- JoJo tries to switch late with Colby; ends up with NOBODY on the #1 WR on the weak side
- Barrett recognizes this and breaks up the pass; this is a TD-saving play
- NOT good recognition from Jude the W linebacker on that side that had NO CB with him

### 4th Down
- Henry still NOT pressed on the #2 WR when there are 3 to one side!
- Jude 5 yards off with NO #2 on his side AND DOESN'T BLITZ! I have no idea what you are doing on this play

- Avery and Hank chatting at the snap of the ball; probably because I forgot to give a call!
