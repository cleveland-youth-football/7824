### Offensive Line
- BOB or big on big
- OTs take the DEs
- OGs take the NT and DT
- C takes the Mike or helps the OGs

### Skill Positions
- #2 WRs are running the speed outs at 5yds
- #1 WRs are running MOR go or fade routes on the outside
- T is running swing or arrow routes
- Q is reading the CB, if the #1 WR is nearly even or even with the CB, throw the go
	- otherwise, if the #2 out leverages the OLB throw the speed out
	- finally the check down (CD) is the T in the flat
	- in Green (2x2) the Q can choose which side has better leverage and lineup the T opposite
