## General Notes About the Game
- Special teams was quite good actually
	- nice kicks from Jude and Barrett
	- nice recovery from Seth
- Offense struggle a lot early on, but turned it on late
	- Nice fight from Oliver
	- OL still struggles with OZ; why?
- WRs did not run correct routes OFTEN
	- Jojo ran incorrect routes
	- Oliver, Drake B don't know what a post route is
	- Calder gave terrible effort
	- EVERYONE GOT LAZY AND STOPPED RUNNING!
- Defense played soft and got beat by one kid!
	- Often I was expecting 8 players to be OVERWHELMING their OL and making the tackle in the back field
	- Jojo needed to stay a bit back and let that happen and clean up whatever was left
	- That would have been a win if I could get 8 players to attack the ball in unison
	- Instead:
		- DEs breaking contain
		- OLB play continues to be very poor and not following coaching directives
		- ILBs are missing tackles and not blitzing correctly
		- DTs were largely ineffective
		- CBs were mostly unchallenged
- Selfish plays from:
	- Jojo
	- Drake M
	- Seth
	- Henry
	- Jude
## Some specific plays/players called out
##### Seth not being aggressive
- https://youtu.be/M0evu_gME44?t=487
##### Henry freelancing inside gives up a huge play and TD
- https://youtu.be/M0evu_gME44?t=526
- https://youtu.be/BwdsEF7_enU?t=127
- Henry #9 is obviously there to block the DE; you have to read that and fill behind underneath!
- Robert don't get stiff-armed! Drag him down by the arm he offers you!
##### Terrible route from Calder; then free-lancing from Avery and Jojo
- https://youtu.be/M0evu_gME44?t=751
##### Terrible route by Boyd & Weak throw end in interception
- https://youtu.be/M0evu_gME44?t=825
- terrible call by me; should have called and executed the throwback to Jude
- This is Catapult Oliver; your position, usually Calder, DOES NOT EVEN GO DOWN FIELD!
- https://youtu.be/BwdsEF7_enU?t=231
##### Henry why are we standing around when there is a fumble?
- https://youtu.be/M0evu_gME44?t=1018
##### Hitting the Punter gave them a new set of downs
- https://youtu.be/M0evu_gME44?t=1059
##### Our best defensive rep
- https://youtu.be/M0evu_gME44?t=1349
- Sack for Corbin !
- Drake B goaded(tricked) into taking a personal foul by `#9`
##### This is how you take revenge on an ahole
- https://youtu.be/M0evu_gME44?t=1409
- TFL by Drake M on `#9`
##### Perfect defensive rep; textbook tackle by Henry
- https://youtu.be/M0evu_gME44?t=1509
##### Milo (all RBs) you cannot freelance in gap-scheme runs
- https://youtu.be/M0evu_gME44?t=1596
- https://youtu.be/BwdsEF7_enU?t=498
- Weak kickout block Henry
- Gap scheme is Trap/Counter/Power
- Jude we need to recognize that they have LBs rolled down into the gaps; this is not going to work
##### So many things wrong
- https://youtu.be/M0evu_gME44?t=1770
- https://youtu.be/BwdsEF7_enU?t=544
- Jude you gave up on the pocket WAY TOO SOON; Barrett (alert H) pops wide open
- Lazy, terrible hitch route by Jojo
- Avery quits on route; ball sails by
##### Nice Punt Jude
- https://youtu.be/BwdsEF7_enU?t=581
##### Henry (all LBs) this is what a blitz looks like when it is picked up
- https://youtu.be/M0evu_gME44?t=2045
##### Nice pitch by Jude and run by Levi for a big gain
- https://youtu.be/M0evu_gME44?t=2131
#### Interception returned for a TD (so many errors Jude)
- https://youtu.be/M0evu_gME44?t=2199
- https://youtu.be/BwdsEF7_enU?t=682
- need to wait longer to get the T out further to block the edge
- because the edge wasn't blocked, you were rushed to roll out and make a play
- The play is named because it floods three players at different levels on one side of the field; 
- You threw behind Jojo and #3 intercepted it
- Jojo this is a 10 yd out, not a 5 yd out!
- Meanwhile, Oliver AND Avery were open on this play
- You then threw a fit on the field instead of tracking down the player immediately
- When you go close to making a play you CHOSE not to be physical and make a tackle on `#3`
- Henry pls worry about your own play instead of criticizing your teammate QB
##### Why did you sign up for Football Colby???
- https://youtu.be/BwdsEF7_enU?t=743
##### Sending in a play with Oliver
- https://youtu.be/M0evu_gME44?t=2517
- Oliver I send in Pearce to run Rado 2 to tell you a play
- I instruct you to tell Barrett to you in the flat
- Barrett claims you never told him this and throws the ball away to I do not know who
- look at how WIDE OPEN OLIVER IS ON THIS PLAY!!!
##### Levi backing up on on Punt messes up Jude's follow through
- https://youtu.be/M0evu_gME44?t=2597
- https://youtu.be/BwdsEF7_enU?t=797
##### TERRIBLE CALL BY ME; meant to call Viking with Jojo running the Post
- https://youtu.be/M0evu_gME44?t=2892
- https://youtu.be/BwdsEF7_enU?t=892
- Jojo you ran the absolute wrong route and you and Avery are standing next to each other!
- Drake B ends up getting injured on this play
##### I have no idea what you are doing Henry; this is OZ-!!!!
- https://youtu.be/M0evu_gME44?t=2945
#### Terrible play on 4th down on our side of the field late in the 2nd Q
- https://youtu.be/M0evu_gME44?t=3159
- I should have punted
- Calder you struggled to be useful all day
- Not sure where this ball was supposed to be placed
- A corner or double move, post-corner would have been better here
- momentum shift, this let them get their 3rd TD of the half
##### The most frustrating effort, aggressiveness
- https://youtu.be/M0evu_gME44?t=3280
- I just had finished asking Jude, "can you ACTUALLY play the OLB position and be aggressive", then this
- Blitz started fine, but then you start dancing and not tackling the player; #3 went the other way for a huge gain
- Seth freelanced inside
- Henry DID NOT DO WHAT I HAVE COACHED HIM A THOUSAND TIMES TO DO!!!!
##### Wrong play in unison WORKS!
- https://youtu.be/M0evu_gME44?t=3465
- good job, Seth, Avery, Jojo, Jude and Oliver
##### Coach Cory notices a matchup!
- https://youtu.be/M0evu_gME44?t=3517
- Nice job handling the new play
- Nice pass and catch Jude and Jojo
##### Nice job on the fake and run
- https://youtu.be/M0evu_gME44?t=3563
- initial part of the run was nice
- then you got scared and walked out of bounds
- I think you could have much closer and maybe scored if you CHOSE to be physical
##### The WORST Defensive play of the game!!!!
- https://youtu.be/M0evu_gME44?t=3311
- Jude WAY OUT OF POSITION instead of being ready at the snap; don't worry, walk after the fumble and kid waltzes into the end-zone as time expires, cool.
- Terrible alignment and effort by Henry
- Jojo looking back at the scoreboard at the snap of the ball; way out of position considering there were 3 WRs to the short side of the field; walking as #3 scores
- Ball on the ground in the back field, no pressure; he picks it up and scores
- Levi hears the horn and gives up on the play
##### What a kick BARRETT!!!
- https://youtu.be/M0evu_gME44?t=3807
##### Unnecessary Run Outside
- https://youtu.be/M0evu_gME44?t=3890
- Drake M you blew by your assigned spot, let the RB #3 easily escape
- Great job Hank taking on that block from the lineman; this is how it is done, even on a blitz
- Nice tackle Henry, but you DID NOT BLITZ LIKE YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO
- If we played our defense correctly they would have negative yards and no 3rd/4th down conversions
##### When our defensive is DOMINANT; this is the dumb crap they will try
- https://youtu.be/M0evu_gME44?t=3999
- great read by Jojo and being physical on the tackle
##### Awesome Punt Return play!!!
- https://youtu.be/M0evu_gME44?t=4048
- Colby gets absolutely juked
- Seth absolutely decleats some lil kid!!! :) 
- Jojo ALMOST slips past for the TD; again `#3`
##### Terrible version of Power SETH
- https://youtu.be/M0evu_gME44?t=4148
- I have said a thousand times, the DOUBLE TEAM has to push the player back, only get LBs when THEY COME!!!! You went chasing LBs that were backpedaling!!! 
- Ben, alone, gets overpowered and ruins the play
##### Milo in space....
- https://youtu.be/M0evu_gME44?t=4515
- I have said a thousand times, if it's 2x2 and #2 goes away, it is an automatic blitz
- you're too slow to make this tackle in space Milo
- your only chance was to blitz and catch him in the backfield

##### This is not we coached to play our defense
- https://youtu.be/M0evu_gME44?t=5570
- Drake M you need to get to your spot and read, then react; you overran the play, AGAIN
- OLBs check #2 to their side read and react to the run; Henry you need to engage the lineman in front of you
- Hank you attack and make contact but get pushed out of the way
- Avery you need to attack as well
- Milo makes the play, but really because #3 is tired and trips
- Looks like a good defensive play, but it is NOT what we are coaching you to do
- Henry why are you going backwards after read run???? STOP IT
- Corbin I have no idea what you are doing; this should have been your tackle
##### Avery where are you going? Corbin what are you doing?
- https://youtu.be/M0evu_gME44?t=5618
- You are in inside linebacker; you have gap responsibility
- There is a GIANT gap that if you filled would have killed this play
##### Look how many players and we still can't stop him!
- https://youtu.be/M0evu_gME44?t=5675
- Drake M you know you are TOO WIDE, when the OT doesn't peel back to block you
- Hank you overrun this play AGAIN
- Jojo you can't align here; this is where the OLB (Milo) needed to align; I appreciate that you were freelancing trying to take matters in your own hands; but it ultimately doesn't help
- 5 kids around 2 players and he still gets another 10yds after this
![[Pasted image 20241021080817.png]]

##### This is just terrible effort Corbin
- https://youtu.be/M0evu_gME44?t=5723
- No idea what you are doing either Avery
- Looks like we just got tired of competing
- Ultimately this was the score that gave them enough points to win; also the only points they got in the 2nd half
##### Levi you need to bend this inside more aggressively, you had him
- https://youtu.be/M0evu_gME44?t=5967
- Nice two blocks by Calder
##### Oliver's Breakout Party; unfortunately bad call by ref
- https://youtu.be/M0evu_gME44?t=5967
- I understand it, but no need to take our frustration out on a kid and block him in the back, 70yds away from the play Henry
- Unbelievable effort by Oliver
##### Jojo can't have; can't have you losing your cool under pressure
- https://youtu.be/M0evu_gME44?t=6215
- You're frustrated, I get it but this is a selfish play
##### This is it Drake M; nice strip sack
- https://youtu.be/M0evu_gME44?t=6886
##### This is a great example of NOT our Defense
- https://youtu.be/M0evu_gME44?t=4575
- Henry freelancing tripping, Seth on some made up blitz
- Pearce dancing around and not attacking
- Lunging arm tackle from Milo
- Jojo overrunning the play
- didn't play a factor in this terrible play, but it is indicative of the focus and attention to detail

## Maybe some changes for Game 2
- Fake Punt Jude to Jojo "Punt DAMMIT"
- Green Stacked on Indy, Okie and Ogre
- Zmo and Hmo on running plays only
- Use Colo or `Buffs` instead of `Rado`
- Cali has Isaiah at Center?
- Run Yellow Counter/Power (motion) instead of Black; maybe, maybe not
- Cali out of Yellow, H has a seam route; lead T blocker; Jojo switches with Calder at X
- DEs need to be disciplined; put hand into chest of attempted chipper 5yds
- CBs line up halfway or 1/3 of the way between the #1 and #2 WR; especially when they flex these small kids way out
- maybe run 5-3 with Alex at DT
- Need to run Black Ogre 1/2 (Oliver)
- Run Y Indy 1 F* once per quarter
- Y Flo needs to have the T shuffle further pre-snap
- Calder if #9 is on you, block him rather than inside on all edge plays
- fix POST for Drake B and Oliver
- change Tsunami back to something simpler
- Kota 11 means Kota 1 with Jojo and Oliver switched
- Kota 22 means Kota 2 with Jojo and Oliver switched
