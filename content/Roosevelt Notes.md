##### Seth not being aggressive
- https://youtu.be/M0evu_gME44?t=487
##### Henry freelancing inside gives up a huge play and TD
- https://youtu.be/M0evu_gME44?t=526
##### Terrible route from Calder; then free-lancing from Avery and Jojo
- https://youtu.be/M0evu_gME44?t=751
##### Terrible route by Boyd & Weak throw end in interception
- https://youtu.be/M0evu_gME44?t=825
- terrible call by me; show have hit the throwback to Jude
##### Henry why are we standing around when there is a fumble
- https://youtu.be/M0evu_gME44?t=1018
##### Hitting the Punter gave them a new set of downs
- https://youtu.be/M0evu_gME44?t=1059
##### Our best defensive rep
- https://youtu.be/M0evu_gME44?t=1349
- Sack for Corbin !
- Drake B Goaded into taking a personal foul by `#9`
##### This is how you take revenge on an ahole
- https://youtu.be/M0evu_gME44?t=1409
- TFL by Drake M on `#9`
##### Perfect defensive rep; textbook tackle by Henry
- https://youtu.be/M0evu_gME44?t=1509
##### Milo (all RBs) you cannot freelance in gap-scheme runs
- https://youtu.be/M0evu_gME44?t=1596
- Weak kickout block Henry
- Trap
- Power
- Counter
##### So many things wrong
- https://youtu.be/M0evu_gME44?t=1770
- Jude you gave up on the pocket WAY TOO SOON; Barrett (alert H) pops wide open
- Lazy, terrible hitch route by Jojo
- Avery quits on route; ball sails by
##### Henry (all LBs) this is what a blitz looks like when it is picked up
- https://youtu.be/M0evu_gME44?t=2045
##### Nice pitch by Jude and run by Levi for a big gain
- https://youtu.be/M0evu_gME44?t=2131
#### Interception returned for a TD (so many errors Jude)
- https://youtu.be/M0evu_gME44?t=2199
- need to wait longer to get the T out further to block the edge
- because the edge wasn't blocked, you were rushed to roll out and make a play
- The play is named because it floods three players at different levels on one side of the field; 
- You threw behind Jojo and #3 intercepted it
- Meanwhile, Oliver AND Avery were open on this play
- You then threw a fit on the field instead of tracking down the player immediately
- When you go close to making a play you CHOSE not to be physical and make a tackle on `#3`
- Henry pls worry about your own play instead of criticizing your teammate QB
##### Sending in a play with Oliver
- https://youtu.be/M0evu_gME44?t=2517
- Oliver I send in Pearce to run Rado 2 to tell you a play
- I instruct you to tell Barrett to you in the flat
- Barrett claims you never told him this and throws the ball away to I do not know who
- look at how WIDE OPEN OLIVER IS ON THIS PLAY!!!
##### Levi backing up on on Punt messes up Jude's follow through
- https://youtu.be/M0evu_gME44?t=2597
##### TERRIBLE CALL BY ME; meant to call Viking with Jojo running the Post
- https://youtu.be/M0evu_gME44?t=2892
- Drake B ends up getting injured on this play
##### I have no idea what you are doing Henry; this is OZ-!!!!
- https://youtu.be/M0evu_gME44?t=2945
#### Terrible play on 4th down on our side of the field late in the 2nd Q
- https://youtu.be/M0evu_gME44?t=3159
- I should have punted
- Calder you struggled to be useful all day
- Not sure where this ball was supposed to be placed
- A corner or double move, post-corner would have been better here
- momentum shift, this let them get their 3rd TD of the half
##### The most frustrating effort, aggressiveness
- https://youtu.be/M0evu_gME44?t=3280
- I just had finished asking Jude, "can you ACTUALLY play the OLB position and be aggressive", then this
- Blitz started fine, but then you start dancing and not tackling the player; #3 went the other way for a huge gain
- Seth freelanced inside
- Henry DID NOT DO WHAT I HAVE COACHED HIM A THOUSAND TIMES TO DO!!!!

##### Wrong play in unison WORKS!
- https://youtu.be/M0evu_gME44?t=3465
- good job, Seth, Avery, Jojo, Jude and Oliver
##### Coach Cory notices a matchup!
- https://youtu.be/M0evu_gME44?t=3517
- Nice job handling the new play
- Nice pass and catch Jude and Jojo
##### Nice job on the fake and run
- https://youtu.be/M0evu_gME44?t=3563
- initial part of the run was nice
- then you got scared and walked out of bounds
- I think you could have much closer and maybe scored if you CHOSE to be physical

##### The WORST Defensive play of the game!!!!
- https://youtu.be/M0evu_gME44?t=3311
- Jude WAY OUT OF POSITION instead of being ready at the snap
- Terrible alignment and effort by Henry
- Jojo looking back at the scoreboard at the snap of the ball; way out of position considering there were 3 WRs to the short side of the field; walking as #3 scores
- Ball on the ground in the back field, no pressure; he picks it up and scores
- Levi hears the horn and gives up on the play
##### What a kick BARRETT!!!
- https://youtu.be/M0evu_gME44?t=3807
##### Unnecessary Run Outside
- https://youtu.be/M0evu_gME44?t=3890
- Drake M you blew by your assigned spot, let the RB #3 easily escape
- Great job Hank taking on that block from the lineman; this is how it is done, even on a blitz
- Nice tackle Henry, but you DID NOT BLITZ LIKE YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO
- If we played our defense correctly they would have negative yards and no 3rd/4th down conversions
##### When our defensive is DOMINANT; this is the dumb crap they will try
- https://youtu.be/M0evu_gME44?t=3999
- great read by Jojo and being physical on the tackle
##### Awesome Punt Return play!!!
- https://youtu.be/M0evu_gME44?t=4048
- Colby gets absolutely juked
- Seth absolutely decleats some lil kid!!! :) 
- Jojo ALMOST slips past for the TD; again `#3`
##### Terrible version of Power SETH
- https://youtu.be/M0evu_gME44?t=4148
- I have said a thousand times, the DOUBLE TEAM has to push the player back, only get LBs when THEY COME!!!! You went chasing LBs that were backpedaling!!! 
##### Milo in space....
- https://youtu.be/M0evu_gME44?t=4515
- I have said a thousand times, if it's 2x2 and #2 goes away, it is an automatic blitz
- you're too slow to make this tackle in space Milo
- your only chance was to blitz and catch him in the backfield
##### This is not we coached to play our defense
- https://youtu.be/M0evu_gME44?t=5570
- Drake M you need to get to your spot and read, then react; you overran the play, AGAIN
- OLBs check #2 to their side read and react to the run; Henry you need to engage the lineman in front of you
- Hank you attack and make contact but get pushed out of the way
- Avery you need to attack as well
- Milo makes the play, but really because #3 is tired and trips
- Looks like a good defensive play, but it is NOT what we are coaching you to do
- Henry why are you going backwards after read run???? STOP IT
- Corbin I have no idea what you are doing; this should have been your tackle
##### Avery where are you going? Corbin what are you doing?
- https://youtu.be/M0evu_gME44?t=5618
- You are in inside linebacker; you have gap responsibility
- There is a GIANT gap that if you filled would have killed this play
##### Look how many players and we still can't stop him!
- https://youtu.be/M0evu_gME44?t=5675
- Drake M you know you are TOO WIDE, when the OT doesn't peel back to block you
- Hank you overrun this play AGAIN
- Jojo you can't align here; this is where the OLB (Milo) needed to align; I appreciate that you were freelancing trying to take matters in your own hands; but it ultimately doesn't help
- 5 kids around 2 players and he still gets another 10yds after this
![[Pasted image 20241021080817.png]]

##### This is just terrible effort Corbin
- https://youtu.be/M0evu_gME44?t=5723
- No idea what you are doing either Avery
- Looks like we just got tired of competing
- Ultimately this was the score that gave them enough points to win; also the only points they got in the 2nd half
##### Levi you need to bend this inside more aggressively, you had him
- https://youtu.be/M0evu_gME44?t=5967
- Nice two blocks by Calder
##### Oliver's Breakout Party; unfortunately bad call by ref
- https://youtu.be/M0evu_gME44?t=5967
- I understand it, but no need to take our frustration out on a kid and block him in the back, 70yds away from the play Henry
- Unbelieveable effort by Oliver
##### Jojo can't have; can't have you losing your cool under pressure
- https://youtu.be/M0evu_gME44?t=6215
- You're frustrated, I get it but this is a selfish play
##### This is it Drake M; nice strip sack
- https://youtu.be/M0evu_gME44?t=6886
##### Amyr's excellent videography
