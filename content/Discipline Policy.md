Football has a lot of plays, a lot of players, a lot of positions and a lot to know about and execute on. Players should therefore be focused on the coaching they are being given.

Distractions can be:
- talking when asked not to
- being disrespectful to coaches, teammates or themselves
- refusing to follow coaching
- fighting, etc

1. Initially the coaches will attempt to deal with the issue in the normal ways.
2. Next a meeting with parents or guardian
3. Then possible missing of participation in a game or games
4. Asked to leave the team

It is our goal to coach and educate these young kids on competing in sports, learning to play football and learn some life skills along the way if possible. Distractions from being able to do this will not be allowed to linger.
