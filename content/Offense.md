[[2WR Routes]]

We are a spread offense using the `pistol` and `shotgun` formations.
- `Q` (quarterback) depth is at 5yds for `pistol` _and_ `shotgun`
- `T` (tailback another name for running back) is 
	- directly behind the `Q` when in `pistol`
	- to one side of the `Q` at the `B` gap or beyond, slightly behind the `Q`
- `H` or H-Back is a hybrid between the `FB` (fullback) and `TE` (tight-end)
- `Z`  is the #1 `WR` on the Strong side of every formation, _always_ OFF the LOS
- `X` is the #1 `WR` on the Weak side of every formation, _always_ ON the LOS
- `Y` is the #2 `WR` on the Strong side of every formation, _always_ ON the LOS

The movement of primarily one player, `H`, is how we move from one formation to the next. Additionally the `X` maybe move further out when `H` joins the weak side of the formation on `Green` and `Yellow` formations.

We utilize `motion` (moving a player laterally along the line LOS prior to the snap) to get the player into position to make a block or get open for a pass. We want to emphasize moving players from one side of the field, because this stresses and confuses the defense.

### Trap `Bama`
![[Pasted image 20240725115750.png]]
- `trap` blocking is a gap scheme where the `DEs` are ignored and instead the `OT` (offensive tackles) go straight for linebackers
- the `C` (center) snaps the ball and then seals the `NT` in the "shade" or a `1-tech` (A gap)
- the `G` (guard) that shares the same A gap with the `C`, pulls around the `C` and hits the `DT`; the rushing player will follow this block
- the other `G` leaves the `DT` (mentioned above) for an inside `LB`
- This play is quick hitting and leaves the `DEs` unblocked because they won't have an opportunity to get in on the play
- meanwhile the play side `G` and the two `Ts` skip to blocking the `LBs` directly

### Power/Counter `Rado`

- like `trap`, `power/counter` features gap-scheme blocking; this means players have designated defenders to block before the ball is snapped
- for both `power` and `counter`, the `DE` is unblocked, because the PS (playside) `T` and `G` double team the inside down lineman (`NT` or `DT`) and work back to the _2nd_ `LB`, leaving the 1st for the wrapping player
- `power` / `counter` are physical runs because every block with leverage with players having clear assignments
- for simplicity, we have made `power` always go to the strength of the formation and `counter` to weak
- `power` and `counter` blocking is exactly the same except which player "kicks" and which "wraps"

#### Power (Strong)
![[Pasted image 20240725115853.png]]
- `power` has the `H` "kick out" the unblocked `DE`; the pulling `G` wraps through the hole to block the PS (play side) `LB`

- [[Matt Jones - Offensive Line Pulling Techniques]]
#### Counter (Weak)
![[Pasted image 20240725115912.png]]
- `counter` is the opposite with the `G` "kicking out" and the `H` "wrapping" through the hole to block the PS `LB`
- this is why for us `counters` will always be named "HG Counter" or "ZG Counter"

## Pass

### Snack `Kota`

This family features three routes that can be run by different players and different positions. The routes
- clear out on the outside
- flat
- and the `stop` or `stick` route just inside the force player 
- 
This play puts the outside defender in conflict between covering the `stick` and the `flat`. He can't be right. The `Q` should throw wherever he isn't.

#### Stick
![[Pasted image 20240725183702.png]]
- #1 WR runs the clear out streak, with a mandatory-outside-release (mor)
- #2 WR runs the `stick` route 1yd behind and 1yd inside of where the `OLB` was at the snap
- the `T`, `H` or #3 WR runs to the `flat`
#### Videos

- [[The Stick Concept Why It Works Against Anything]]
#### Snag
![[Pasted image 20240725120640.png]]
- #1 WR runs the `stop` or `snag` route in the same position as `stick`; 1yd behind and 1yd inside of the `OLB`
- #2 WR runs the `corner` route at 8-10 yards
- the `T`, `H` or #3 WR runs to the `flat`

#### Bow
![[Pasted image 20240725133103.png]]
- #1 WR runs the `stop` or `snag` route in the same position as `stick`; 1yd behind and 1yd inside of the `OLB`
- #2 WR runs the `dig` route at 8-10 yards
- the `T`, `H` or #3 WR runs to the `flat`

### Mesh `Mich`
![[Pasted image 20240725120817.png]]

- inside WRs slap hands as the `H` goes _under_ the `Y`
- the `under` route`H`, should pop free on the other side of the OL after clearing the `Y` and `Z` running "rub routes"

### Cross `Hai`
- two similar concepts
	- v1 `y-cross`
	- v2 `shallow cross`
#### Y-Cross
![[Pasted image 20240725120926.png]]
- `Y` is getting across the field to the far hash at 12yds
- `Y` must go _under_ the `S` linebacker and _over_ the `M`linebacker, getting vertical while passing between where they lined up, then flattening out on way to the far hash

#### Shallow Cross
![[Pasted image 20240725183729.png]]
- the shallow cross player must `drag` across the field on the `LOS` or the heels of the DL
- the opposite #2 WR has a `MOR` and then runs a `dig/in` at 10yds
