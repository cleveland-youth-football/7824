[[2WR Routes]]

We are a spread offense using the `pistol` and `shotgun` formations.
- `Q` (quarterback) depth is at 5yds for `pistol` _and_ `shotgun`
- `T` (tailback another name for running back) is 
	- directly behind the `Q` when in `pistol`
	- to one side of the `Q` at the `B` gap or beyond, slightly behind the `Q`
- `H` or H-Back is a hybrid between the `FB` (fullback) and `TE` (tight-end)
- `Z`  is the #1 `WR` on the Strong side of every formation, _always_ OFF the LOS
- `X` is the #1 `WR` on the Weak side of every formation, _always_ ON the LOS
- `Y` is the #2 `WR` on the Strong side of every formation, _always_ ON the LOS

The movement of primarily one player, `H`, is how we move from one formation to the next. Additionally the `X` maybe move further out when `H` joins the weak side of the formation on `Green` and `Yellow` formations.

We utilize `motion` (moving a player laterally along the line LOS prior to the snap) to get the player into position to make a block or get open for a pass. We want to emphasize moving players from one side of the field, because this stresses and confuses the defense.
