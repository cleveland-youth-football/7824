[[Zone-Blocking]]

## Assignments

### Offensive Line
- `C` ids the `Mike` `LB`, aka the first `LB` on the `PS`
	- `C` then calls double team with either `PS G` with "Ace" or `BS G` via "Uno"
	- `PS` `G` & `T` with "Deuce"; `BS` `G` & `T` with "Duo"
- first step `PS` , aims the screws of the player's helmet at the defender's outside armpit and player's `BS` leg should be placed directly between the defender's legs
- player is not push vertically, nor horizontally, but at a 45 degree angle, trying to "reach" and cut off the defender's path
- `BS` "strike hand" should be in the defender's sternum
- `PS` hand should be "free" in case a defender tries to cut across their player
- `covered` takes the player in their `PS` gap trying to "reach them" knowing that they have help `BS`
- `uncovered` helps `PS` with double teams to the `LB`; `uncovered` tries to overtake the block of their `covered` partner in the double team
- if `uncovered` can't help double team after 3 steps, they climb to find a `LB`
- `head up` leave this player unblocked for the lineman to the `BS` to pick up with their reach block

### Skill Positions
- `T's` aim point is the outside hip of the "ghost tight-end"
- `T` makes a decision by their `5th` step whether to continue to press outside or cutback in under gaps that have formed
- `PS` `WRs` stalk block just their defender or `mdm`, just like [[Inside-Zone]]
- `BS` `WRs` have a backside `bubble screen` by default
	- most inside turns towards the `Q` and backpedals perpindicular to the `LOS` looking for a pass
	- the outside `WR|s` stalk block their defender
