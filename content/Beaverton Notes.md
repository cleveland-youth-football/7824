- WTH are you running Avery and JoJo?

https://youtu.be/NWBWZrgsKMM?t=49
- Oliver no hugging in football

https://youtu.be/NWBWZrgsKMM?t=112
- Levi on punts and kickoffs we force the player back to the middle where our defense is; or make the tackle
- Keep your head up Drake M, crackback block like this is how Henry got a concussion last year

https://youtu.be/NWBWZrgsKMM?t=147
- Jude if nothing comes out of the backfield this is a blitz to your side; instead of dancing around, tackle the ball carrier in the backfield!

https://youtu.be/NWBWZrgsKMM?t=234
- Jude it took me calling this 2-3 times before you threw the ball; see how even a not perfect spiral can get the job done?
- nice block from Oliver on his way to the flat

https://youtu.be/NWBWZrgsKMM?t=268
- Levi, Avery, Oliver & Milo you have to line up on the LOS; terrible!
- wouldn't have mattered anyway, because Drake was just getting warmed up on his high snaps for the day!

https://youtu.be/NWBWZrgsKMM?t=287
- Henry why are we arm tackling and failing?

https://youtu.be/NWBWZrgsKMM?t=306
- Jude why are you dancing instead of being aggressive and making a tackle?

https://youtu.be/NWBWZrgsKMM?t=325
- Jude you are blitz dancing and lost coverage; would have been an easy completion to the uncovered kid
- Oliver youre supposed to be a receiver, why are we dropping that easy interception?

https://youtu.be/NWBWZrgsKMM?t=354
- watch JoJo read the play, close and make a physical tackle at the LOS!

https://youtu.be/NWBWZrgsKMM?t=394
- Oliver why are you fumbling the ball two times with no contact???

https://youtu.be/NWBWZrgsKMM?t=474
- Seth this is what DE play looks like; cracking WR get wrecked on your way to making the tackle!
- Jude watching on and trying to arm tackle...

https://youtu.be/NWBWZrgsKMM?t=520
- Jude leaves his man to be at the LOS, why? Henry doen't fill his area and the reverse comes right through where he is supposed to be; nice tackle by Levi

https://youtu.be/NWBWZrgsKMM?t=556
- Drake B would love a more physical tackle here
- Isaiah you stand up and put hands on a player without trying to get by, and then quit while the play is still going on

https://youtu.be/NWBWZrgsKMM?t=595
- terrible Corbin

https://youtu.be/NWBWZrgsKMM?t=631
- Yellow Oregon 2 was called; OLine lined up and ran the play the wrong way! Unbelievable! 

https://youtu.be/NWBWZrgsKMM?t=652
- threw it when you could have run for the first down, not to mention Oliver is wide open in front of you.

https://youtu.be/NWBWZrgsKMM?t=670
- Jude unwilling to make a tackle

https://youtu.be/NWBWZrgsKMM?t=688
- Jude unwilling to make a tackle again

https://youtu.be/NWBWZrgsKMM?t=738
- Jude unwilling to be physical and make a block

https://youtu.be/NWBWZrgsKMM?t=799
- Oliver unwilling to be physical and make a block

https://youtu.be/NWBWZrgsKMM?t=871
- Jude dancing around refusing to be physical and make a tackle

https://youtu.be/NWBWZrgsKMM?t=886
- Jude dancing around refusing to be physical and make a tackle

https://youtu.be/NWBWZrgsKMM?t=957
- Jude not in a LB stance, not ready for the snap, then dancing around as someone else makes the tackle

https://youtu.be/NWBWZrgsKMM?t=1020
- Jude lined up incorrectly (not behind the DE); waiting for someone else to make the tackle (Robert)

https://youtu.be/NWBWZrgsKMM?t=1055
- Whole OLine Ol√©s the DL and Jude makes a good play with a run for a TD; great blocking by Levi

https://youtu.be/NWBWZrgsKMM?t=1149
- Drake M doesn't get to his spot; Henry snoops to the otherside of the ball; reverse hurts us; Calder nice tackle

https://youtu.be/NWBWZrgsKMM?t=1212
- Drake B leaves Corbin to whiff and ruin Hank's run

https://youtu.be/NWBWZrgsKMM?t=1242
- Looking at the rush rather than throwing the 1-3 step drop

https://youtu.be/NWBWZrgsKMM?t=1263
- Jude too close (supposed to be 9yds); I asked him to punt away from the returner, instead sends it right to him

https://youtu.be/NWBWZrgsKMM?t=1321
- Drake M takes a bad angle and lets the QB break to the outside over the top

https://youtu.be/NWBWZrgsKMM?t=1342
- more dancing from Jude

https://youtu.be/NWBWZrgsKMM?t=1422
- another nice option pitch from Jude ruined by not aggressively running the ball up field AND fumbling it!

https://youtu.be/NWBWZrgsKMM?t=1466
- this is terrible Jude; you're supposed to be blitzing; terrible effort on the tackle

https://youtu.be/NWBWZrgsKMM?t=1524
- nice run by Milo ruined by whiff block from Calder.

https://youtu.be/NWBWZrgsKMM?t=1534
- Milo lined up incorrectly behind Jude; terrible execution by Jude not getting the ball to Milo immediately; making an easy play look difficult

https://youtu.be/NWBWZrgsKMM?t=1584
- Jude what are you doing? This is a blitz! You dance right into a block AGAIN
- Should have been a strip sack  for Seth and recovery for Drake M; but alas the refs were dumb

https://youtu.be/NWBWZrgsKMM?t=1608
- Jude again, this is a blitz, why are you stopping to put hands on the blocker? Run through the smaller kid to the QB!

https://youtu.be/NWBWZrgsKMM?t=1636
- again no blitz by either OLB!

https://youtu.be/NWBWZrgsKMM?t=1653
- Jude why let Henry make the tackle solo, when you could join late and go for the ball?

https://youtu.be/NWBWZrgsKMM?t=1701
- Drake M breaks contain, I lose my mind; gives up a first down to a team we were starving 

https://youtu.be/NWBWZrgsKMM?t=1765
- Jude you get a free run at this QB, yet he is able to deliver the quick out.... Hint, hint

https://youtu.be/NWBWZrgsKMM?t=1816
- Drake M again broken contain over the top; JoJo hit sticks the WR to save 2pts
