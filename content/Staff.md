# Coaching 

### Who are we?
- physically fit
- well prepared and organized

Our goal is teach the game of football and the skills therein to prepare our young athletes to join the HS team. It has be enjoyable for the kids. Our approach is teach them what it means to prepare and compete. Through this they will bond as a team as they find success and failure, just like the real world they are preparing to enter.

Note about the difference of Football from other sports. There is a reason that it is only played once a week. You do not get out of the football game without bumps and bruises. It is a tough sport.

# Players
- should be on time to practice and games; of course communication a head of time for exceptions is fine
- players should represent themselves and the organization well; no cussing at practice, games or otherwise representing the Cleveland football team
- Players will show up 1hr 15m prior to the game on game day. This allows us to transition to game day mode.

# Parents
- if you want to address something with a coach, please setup an appointment via text or email
- don't approach before or after practice and definitely not on Game Day
- discussions about playing time or position etc will be player-led and by setting up an appoint as mentioned before
- do not engage with reffing or other field officials
- please don't engage with players during games as we require their attention with the team
- please don't engage with the coaching staff from the sideline during games either
