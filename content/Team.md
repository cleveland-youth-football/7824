A football team has lot's of people to make it possible!  Here is some information about the people involved in the campaign.

# Who Are We? 
- physically fit, aggressive
- well prepared and organized

Our goal is teach the game of football and the skills therein to prepare our young athletes to join the Cleveland HS team. It has be enjoyable for the kids. Our approach is teach them what it means to prepare and compete. Through this they will bond as a team as they find success and failure, just like the real world they are preparing to enter.

Note about the difference of Football from other sports. There is a reason that it is only played once a week. You do not get out of the football game without bumps and bruises. It is a tough sport.

# What is Your Role?

## Players

This whole endeavor is about the youth football players.  Everything we do will be in service of them and their understanding and growth in the sport of Football.

#### Expectations
- should be on time to practice and games; of course communication a head of time for exceptions is fine
- players should represent themselves and the organization well
	- no cussing at practice, game or when attending any Cleveland Youth Football function
	- no arguing or fighting with teammates
	- no behavior reflecting poorly on the Cleveland Football team
- Players will show up 1hr 15m prior to the game on game day. This allows us to transition to game day mode.

## Parents

Parents are the ultimate fans for the team, both for their athletes as well as the classmates that form the team. This is because they have vested interest in seeing their youth athlete be challenged and rise to the challenge, learning life lessons along the way. We know this because, we (the coaches), are parents and have experienced, or are experiencing this.

#### How to Engage:
- if you want to address something with a coach, please setup an appointment via text or email
- don't approach before or after practice and definitely not on Game Day
- discussions about playing time or position etc will be player-led and by setting up an appoint as mentioned before
- do not engage with reffing or other field officials
- please don't engage with players during games as we require their attention with the team
- please don't engage with the coaching staff from the sideline during games either

## Coaches
- follow all of the safety guidelines and procedures
- always keep the young athletes best interests in mind
- will communicate clearly and early with Players and Parents
- set clear expectations for what we are doing and why we are doing it
- take seriously the responsibility of coaching the Parents' youth athletes
