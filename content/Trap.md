The Trap play is a `gap-scheme` play where you "trap" the `DT` (Defensive Tackle) usually in the `B gap`. For us, it will always be run away from the `NT` (Nose Tackle) usually in the `A gap`. Meaning there is no `strong` vs `weak` for this play like there is for others.

## Assignments
- `trap` blocking is a gap scheme where the `DEs` are ignored and instead the `OT` (offensive tackles) go straight for linebackers
- the `C` (center) snaps the ball and then seals the `NT` in the "shade" or a `1-tech` (A gap)
- the `G` (guard) that shares the same A gap with the `C`, pulls around the `C` and hits the `DT`; the rushing player will follow this block
- the other `G` leaves the `DT` (mentioned above) for an inside `LB`
- This play is quick hitting and leaves the `DEs` unblocked because they won't have an opportunity to get in on the play
- meanwhile the play side `G` and the two `Ts` skip to blocking the `LBs` directly

### Offensive Line
- `Center` will down block back on the `NT` in their `A gap`.
- `Guard` sharing the the `A gap` with `Center` will pull and kickout the `DT`
- opposite `Guard` will "punch" the `DT` on their way to the `BS` (backside) `LB` (Linebacker)
- both `Tackles` will skip their `DE` (Defensive Ends) on their way to `LBs`
### Skill Positions
- The running back (`H` in Black and `T` in `Green` and `Yellow`) will take the handoff and follow the kickout block by the pulling `Guard`; follow the block, no cutbacks
- `X`, `Y` and `Z` `stalk block` on the `PS` (playside) and `crack screen` by default on the `BS` (backside)
- `Q` will handoff and then carry out a playfake rollout (if appropriate)
