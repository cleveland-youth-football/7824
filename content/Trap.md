The Trap play is a `gap-scheme` play where you "trap" the `DT` (Defensive Tackle) usually in the `B gap`. For us, it will always be run away from the `NT` (Nose Tackle) usually in the `A gap`. Meaning there is no `strong` vs `weak` for this play like there is for others.

## Assignments

### Offensive Line
- `Center` will down block back on the `NT` in their `A gap`.
- `Guard` sharing the the `A gap` with `Center` will pull and kickout the `DT`
- opposite `Guard` will "punch" the `DT` on their way to the `BS` (backside) `LB` (Linebacker)
- both `Tackles` will skip their `DE` (Defensive Ends) on their way to `LBs`
### Skill Positions
- The running back (`H` in Black and `T` in `Green` and `Yellow`) will take the handoff and follow the kickout block by the pulling `Guard`; follow the block, no cutbacks
- `X`, `Y` and `Z` `stalk block` on the `PS` (playside) and `crack screen` by default on the `BS` (backside)
- `Q` will handoff and then carry out a playfake rollout (if appropriate)
