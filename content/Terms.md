- `MDM`: most dangerous man; this means the defender in the best position to disrupt the offensive play or make a tackle
- `MOR`: mandatory outside release; this is to tell WRs that they need to release to the outside at the snap of the ball and get the defender, usually a DB, to turn their hips and head away from the QB
- `LOS` line of scrimmage; this is the shorthand to describe the invisible line that represents the two sides of the ball, offense and defense, before the snap of the ball to begin the play
- `EMOL` end man on the LOS; this refers to the last player on the line of scrimmage; this is usually the DE (Defensive End) but it could be an OLB (Outside Linebacker) rolling up to the LOS
- `The Box` area of the field from DE to DE extending to 5yds; this is helpful for the QB to count how many defenders  are clustered around the ball just opposite of the offensive line. This is useful to know if you should run plays into the middle or exploit the edges with outside runs, passes and screens
- `The Sidewalk` the area of the field between the bottom of the numbers and the sideline. Note: there is a sidewalk on each edge of the field
- `The Alley` the area of the field between the top of the numbers and the nearest hash. Note: there is an `alley` on each side of the `center` of the field.
- `The Middle or Center of the Field`; this the area of the field in between the hashes.
