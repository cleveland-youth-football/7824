## Assignments

### Offensive Line
- [[Power-Counter|Power]] blocking on `Black` 2x1, without the kickout block; instead we "read" the unblocked `DE`
- [[Outside-Zone]] blocking on `Green` (2x2) and `Yellow` (3x1)

### Skill Positions
- `stalk blocking` on `PS`
- `bubble screens` on `BS` where possible
- on `Black` the `Q` attacks the `unblocked DE`; if he moves towards the `Q`, "shovel pitch" forward to the trailing `H`; otherwise "lateral pitch" to the `T`
- on `Green` or `Yellow` `Q` should attack the force player on the edge, if challenged, "lateral pitch" to the `T`
- `T` should always remain in pitch-relation to the `Q`; 2yds behind vertically (so pitches are laterals) and 5-8yds wider than the `Q`on the `PS` so that when a  pitch does happen there is  distance between the players
