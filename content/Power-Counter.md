## Assignments
- like `trap`, `power/counter` features gap-scheme blocking; this means players have designated defenders to block before the ball is snapped
- for both `power` and `counter`, the `DE` is unblocked, because the PS (playside) `T` and `G` double team the inside down lineman (`NT` or `DT`) and work back to the _2nd_ `LB`, leaving the 1st for the wrapping player
- `power` / `counter` are physical runs because every block with leverage with players having clear assignments
- for simplicity, we have made `power` always go to the strength of the formation and `counter` to weak
- `power` and `counter` blocking is exactly the same except which player "kicks" and which "wraps"
