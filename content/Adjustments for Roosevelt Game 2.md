# Defense
### We switched to a `5-3 Defense`
- this affected ONLY 4 players
	- NT
	- DT
	- S LB
	- M LB
- now we have
	- 2 DTs in the `B Gaps`
	- NT "headup" on the Center
	- M LB directly behind the DT at 4-5yds
- EVERYTHING ELSE IS EXACTLY THE SAME
	- DEs, OLBs W and R, Corners and Safety all have the exact same assignments
### DEs must get to their 5yds depth first
- if someone is trying to cap you; physical and strong to your spot, hand in their chest
- don't fly deeper than 5yds, you must get to your spot

# Offense
### CBs lineup halfway between #1 and #2 or OL
- Roosevelt is not a good passing team
- CBs should NOT lineup over the top of the outside WR
- instead line up halfway between #1 and #2 or #1 and OL when they only have one
### We added "stacked" to Green formations for 3 runs
- Indy, Okie and Ogre out of Green can be "stacked"
- lineup in green
- QB will motion H and Y to stack behind X and in front of Z wide
- QB will read if the defense moves the force player further out to cover this
	- if so, run the called run play: Indy, Okie or Ogre
	- if not, throw the bubble screen to Z or H
### We added the ability to put Z or H in motion on 4 runs
- Indy, Okie, Ogre and Buffs can have the Z or H put in motion
- This is to confuse the defense
- We just move one player and run the play, simple
### Kota 11 and 22
- this is just Kota 1 and 2
- `H` Oliver swaps position with `Z` Jojo
- Jojo runs the flat on both 
- Oliver needs to run the MOR go route for 1 and snag route for 2
### Rado -> Buffs
- our call for Counter / Power is changed to use Buffs
- other team is trying to stop our Colorado plays
- we switch to "Buffs" to throw them off
### Changed Tsunami back to something simpler
- only moved the `T` to the strong side to easier lead block protect 
- the `X` now slides behind the OL and to the opposite flat; `Q` can hit you late
### Punt DAMMIT
- we added a fake punt from Jude to Jojo
- we only do this if coach Scott scream "PUNT DAMMIT" from the sidelines
