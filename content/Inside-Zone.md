## Assignments

### Offensive Line
- `C` ids the `Mike` `LB`, aka the first `LB` on the `PS`
	- `C` then calls double team with either `PS G` with "Ace" or `BS G` via "Uno"
	- `PS` `G` & `T` with "Deuce"; `BS` `G` & `T` with "Duo"
- first step `PS` , aims the screws of the player's helmet at the defender's near V and straddling the the inside leg (`BS`) of the defender
- second step `BS` goes vertical into the defender
- player should "duck walk" with the instep of the foot providing the base
- `BS` "strike hand" armpit to hipbone as the second step lands
- `PS` hand is on the chest plate
- `covered` takes the player in their gap to the `PS`
- `uncovered` helps `BS` with double teams to the `LB`
- `head up` (directly over the player) get treated as a double team from the `head up` offensive lineman & the `BS` offensive lineman


### Skill Positions
- `T's` aiming point is the inside hip of the `PS` `G`; slow roll the approach, allow the blocks to be set. Gap is `PS` `A` or cut back to `BS` `A` or `B`
- `PS` `WRs` stalk block their defender or the `mdm` (most dangerous man)
- `BS` `WRs` have a backside `crack screen` by default
	- for 2 and 3 `WRs` the one or two outside `WRs` block the defender inside of them
	- the most inside `WR` or `RB` runs to the flat, not crossing the `LOS`
	- if there is only one `WR` on the `BS`, then they crack for the `Q` to run a rollout keeper run
